# Esoteric Language Study

## Introduction

1. Learning is fun!
2. Programming is fun!
3. New languages are hard...
4. Esoteric languages are hard...
5. Discovering amazing lessons are invaluable!

I took a dive into esoteric languages during a code interview challenge when I was applying for employment. The code challenge gave the option to use an esoteric language for bonus points, so why not? I would be a fool not to take advantage.

What ended up happening was I was forced to think outside my Javascript box, make me realize that I've had a very comfortable and cushy development experience so far, and lured me with actual appliction of computer science concepts instead of using someone else's implementation.

This one time, I only had ```gotos``` for flow control, and because everything in my academic and professional experience told me never to even consider the use of this functionality, I was very lost! I powered through it and actually understand how I should change my thinking in a goto-based flow control. I think I can even apply those skills to Assembly and pursue embedded systems development! I wouldn't've gained that confidence unless I actually took the time to complete this "seemingly useless" exercise.

## Description
This repository is my collection of source code created during my studies. It is also the accumulated resources I've found while scouring the internet and include my own personal notes and commentaries on how I approached each new language.
